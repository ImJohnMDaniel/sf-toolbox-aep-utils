    - selectSObjectsById base function doesn't honor inherited sharing.  the workaround was to simply custom where clause for method
- add boolean flags to the "toolbox aep generate" command to either domain, selector, and/or uow
- generate selector injection method class 
- generate the files into the default hierarchy folder under the generated folder location
- generate selector selectByParent methods and selectByExternal methods
- generate uow binding
- generate service class related - SVC, ISVC, SVCImpl, SVCException, SVCTest, and ApplicationFactory_ServiceBinding__mdt.SVC.md-meta.xml
- generate FFLIBApexCommon flavors -- right now it is AT4DX flavor
