Roadmap
- generate selector injection method class
- generate domain process injection command
- generate selector field injection command
- generate selector selectByParent methods and selectByExternal methods
- add an "interactive mode" -- flag: -i -- see "sf update -i"
- config setting to specify your own templates 
- vscode extension
- some sort of way to specify a wild card string for sobject that would process all similarly named sobjects instead of processing one-by-one.

Completed
v0.5.0
- generate selector binding
- generate domain binding
- selectById() method
    - selectSObjectsById base function doesn't honor inherited sharing.  the workaround was to simply custom where clause for method
- generate the files into the default hierarchy folder under the generated folder location
- generate uow binding
- generate service class related - SVC, ISVC, SVCImpl, SVCException, SVCTest, and ApplicationFactory_ServiceBinding__mdt.SVC.md-meta.xml
v0.6.0
- aggregate command to execute all others -- toolbox aep generate
    - add boolean flags to the "toolbox aep generate" command to either domain, selector, and/or uow
    - consolidate flags so as to be available from the generate command and the specific "generate selector|domain|unitofwork|service" command
v0.7.0
- generate FFLIBApexCommon flavors -- right now it is AT4DX flavor
